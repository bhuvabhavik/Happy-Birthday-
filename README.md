A new fully responsive Flutter desktop and mobile app to wish happy birthday to a loved ones in a **Software Engineer way**😜😉

It has a simple login screen which has the static code for now--> (800900) ..
Thinking..Authentication screen in such a simple app?
Well, because lot of people have a habit of wishing a birthday with highly unsensored image😂🤣🤪.

Both the images in the app are being fetched dynamic from the internet.
